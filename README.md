# Frontend Web Development Projects

Welcome to the **Frontend Web Development Projects** repository! This repository contains a collection of projects and assignments I completed as part of my **INFO 6150 - Web UI/UX Engineering** course at Northeastern University. These projects and assignments demonstrate my understanding and implementation of frontend web development concepts, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

## Overview

This repository showcases my journey in learning frontend web development fundamentals. Through various projects and assignments, I developed skills in:

- Semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques.
- Creating interactive and responsive user interfaces.
- Writing and debugging JavaScript to add dynamic functionality.
- Building Single Page Applications (SPA) using React.

Each project in this repository highlights a specific area of web development, progressing from static web pages to dynamic, React-powered applications.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jingchenyc/frontend-web-development-projects.git
   cd frontend-web-development-projects
   ```

2. **Navigate to a project or assignment folder**:

   ```bash
   cd project1  # Replace with 'project2', 'final', or 'work' for other folders
   ```

3. **Open in a browser**:
   - For HTML/CSS/JS projects: Open `index.html` in your browser.
   - For React projects:
     - Install dependencies: `npm install`.
     - work:
       - Start the development server: `npm run dev`.
     - project1 and project2:
       - Start the development server: `node server.js`.
     - final project:
       - `npm run build`
       - `npx serve -s dist`
